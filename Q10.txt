Question 10: Write a program in java with class Employee and do the following
			operations on it
			1) Create two constructor default and with Object as parameter to initialize class variables.
			2) Create a function calculate which calculates the pf and allowances on the salary of
			employee and return the all values as an object
			3) Print all the employee an object associated values returned from calculate function

package ict;

class Employee{
    
    float salary;
    String name;

    public Employee(){
        
        this.name = "unknown";
        this.salary = 0;
        
    }
    
    public Employee( String name,float salary) {
        this.salary = salary;
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public void calculate(){
        
         float pf = (float) (salary * 12 /100);
         float allowance = (float)  (salary * 5/100);
         System.out.println("pf of the "+name+" is "+pf);
         System.out.println(allowance);
        
    }
    
}

public class Q10 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        Employee e1 = new Employee("chirag",50000);
        Employee e2 = new Employee();
        e1.calculate();
        e2.calculate();

    }
}

Output:-
		pf of the chirag is 6000.0
		2500.0
		pf of the unknown is 0.0
		0.0
