Question 6: Create a class named 'Shape' with a method to print "This is This is
			shape". Then create two other classes named 'Rectangle', 'Circle' inheriting the Shape
			class, both having a method to print "This is rectangular shape" and "This is circular
			shape" respectively. Create a subclass 'Square' of 'Rectangle' having a method to print
			"Square is a rectangle". Now call the method of 'Shape' and 'Rectangle' class by the
			object of 'Square' class.

package ict;


class shape{
   void print(){
        System.out.println("this is shape");
    }
}
class rectangle101 extends shape{
    void rprint(){
        System.out.println("this is rectangle shape");
    }
}
class circle extends shape{
    void cprint(){
        System.out.println("this is circle shape");
    }
}
class square101 extends rectangle101{
    void sprint(){
        System.out.println("this is square shape");
    }
}
public class Q6 {

    /**
     * @param args the command line arguments
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // TODO code application logic here
        square101 s1 = new square101();
        s1.print();
        s1.rprint();
    }
    
}

Output:-
		this is shape
		this is rectangle shape
